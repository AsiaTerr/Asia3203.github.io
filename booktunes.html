  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This process page will cover the creation of the prototype, BookTunes. This project was created for my Interaction Design 1 class at Kennesaw State University. We were assigned to create a mobile app prototype using Alan Cooper’s Goal Directed Design (GDD) method. This method was taught to us because it covers the full range of what an interaction designer might do in a career. After each student pitched their idea we ranked the pitches from most to least favorite. I ranked Bella Margiano’s BookTunes pitch as number one as it seemed like a creative combination of my favorite hobbies. After being placed on the BookTunes team we began the research process.
The rest of this page will explain GDD and each phase of GDD utilized on this project (Research, Modeling, Requirements, Frameworks, Refinement), and discuss what I learned while working on this project. </p>

  <h2>Goal Directed Design</h2>
  <p>When creating BookTunes we used Alan Cooper’s Goal Directed Design as the guiding method. We learned GGD by reading from About Face(4th Edition) The authors believe designers should be a part of the research process. Cooper et al. finds that when designers focus on users’ goals, expectations, attitudes, and aptitude that can come up with solutions that people find both powerful and pleasurable to use. (xx) For this class project, GDD was modified to fit the parameters of a 16-week college course. We utilized the following phases of GDD:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><strong>Research:</strong> on users and product domain</li>
  <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> synthesizing research, modeling users in context</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements:</strong>  defining the users, business, and technical needs with a focus on achieving their goals</li>
  <li><strong>Framework:</strong>  defining the design's structure, flow, look, and feel</li>
  <li><strong>Refinement:</strong>  of behaviors, form, and content based on tests and feedback</li>
</ol>
