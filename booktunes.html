  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This process page will cover the creation of the prototype, BookTunes. This project was created for my Interaction Design 1 class at Kennesaw State University. We were assigned to create a mobile app prototype using Alan Cooper’s Goal Directed Design (GDD) method. This method was taught to us because it covers the full range of what an interaction designer might do in a career. After each student pitched their idea we ranked the pitches from most to least favorite. I ranked Bella Margiano’s BookTunes pitch as number one as it seemed like a creative combination of my favorite hobbies. After being placed on the BookTunes team we began the research process.
The rest of this page will explain GDD and each phase of GDD utilized on this project (Research, Modeling, Requirements, Frameworks, Refinement), and discuss what I learned while working on this project. </p>

  <h2>Goal Directed Design</h2>
  <p>When creating BookTunes we used Alan Cooper’s Goal Directed Design as the guiding method. We learned GGD by reading from About Face(4th Edition) The authors believe designers should be a part of the research process. Cooper et al. finds that when designers focus on users’ goals, expectations, attitudes, and aptitude that can come up with solutions that people find both powerful and pleasurable to use. (xx) For this class project, GDD was modified to fit the parameters of a 16-week college course. We utilized the following phases of GDD:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><strong>Research:</strong> on users and product domain</li>
  <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> synthesizing research, modeling users in context</li>
  <li><strong>Requirements:</strong>  defining the users, business, and technical needs with a focus on achieving their goals</li>
  <li><strong>Framework:</strong>  defining the design's structure, flow, look, and feel</li>
  <li><strong>Refinement:</strong>  of behaviors, form, and content based on tests and feedback</li>
</ol> 
  <h2>Research Phase</h2>
  <p>We as designers did research to better understand the products user along with business and market context. During this phase we conducted a kickoff meeting, created or collected a literature review and competitive audit, completed stakeholder interviews, and completed user interviews. User research is the foundation on which our design was built. </p>
  <h3>Kickoff Meeting</h3>
  <p>Since this was done a for a class there were no actually stakeholders therefore only a hypothetical kickoff meeting among group members was conducted on FigJam, an online collaborative whiteboard. In this hypothetical kickoff meeting we filled out a worksheet that placed us in the position of stakeholders to imagine what stakeholder might want out of BookTunes. We crafted a Problem Statement, which defines the purpose and reflects a situation that needs changing, and we listed assumptions about the business and users.</p>
  <h4>Problem Statement:</h4>
  <p>The current state of the BookTunes industry lacks a niche-related app that focuses on readers and enhancing the reading experience and has focused primarily on the general generic use of listening to music. What existing products/services fail to address is the desire from readers for an app that offers playlist and music that corresponds with books. Our product/service will address this gap by capitalizing on this niche market by offering readers a central music hub with playlists that correspond with different books and genres.</p>
 <h3>Literature Review</h3>
<p>A literature review is a part of the research phase that provides insight to the design team by reviewing any literature pertaining to the product or its domains. This provides context to our designs and encourages us to make better design decisions based off research.</p>
  <p>Because our app is fusing reading and music together, we researched music industry as it relates to streaming, the book industry and whether there was a demand for this app. The full Literature Review can be read in the Research Report. The key take-aways are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The combination of music and books has been introduced through BookTok (a subcommunity filled with book lovers sharing their reviews, book hauls etc on TikTok)</li>
  <li>Streaming apps is a hot market expect to exponentially grow</li>
  <li>A heavy emphasis on playlists for books is being pushed by streaming apps</li>
  </ul>
