<h1>Visual & Information Design Work</h1>
<h2>Client Information Design Product</h2>
<p>​For my Information Design class I was assigned a client whose information design product I would develop. Using the Concept/Design Brief I created I gathered information on my client and what they wanted. From these notes I created a poster according to their specifications Using Photoshop and InDesign.

  <h2>Bauhaus Design Poster</h2>
  <p>​For this Visual Design class assignment I was to use Adobe Illustrator for the first time to design a poster for a play. The poster is supposed  take inspiration from the Bauhaus' geometrical and angular style.

<h2>Eyeglass Company Poster</h2>
<p>Throughout the semester in my Technical Writing class my group of four was tasked with creating various documents for our imaginary company. For extra credit I myself designed this poster to explain and advertise our product using Adobe Illustrator and Figma.
